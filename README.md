We ask that you do at least 1 in Ruby and 1 in a language  of your choice.

Please do not fork this repository for your answers; that would allow other candidates to see your code. We'll accept most formats, but here are three that others have found useful:
- Duplicate the repository *without forking*. It can still be public. [Github instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/)
- One or more [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
- Email a zip file containing your code
